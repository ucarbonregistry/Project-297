# Project-297
Biomass based Cogeneration Project at Haidergarh, Uttar Pradesh (UCR ID Number: 297)
____
The project activity is a biomass-fired cogeneration facility of a sugar mill, where the surplus electricity generated is exported to the grid. The project supplies up to 20.95 MW of green electricity to the grid. Biomass being a carbon-neutral fuel replaces fossil fuel-powered electricity in the national grid, increasing the share of renewable energy in country's energy mix. This project activity is expected to reduce anthropogenic emissions by 63,805 t-CO2e/Yr.
_____________
PRIOR HISTORY
The project activity titled “BCML Haidergarh Bagasse Co-generation Project (India)” with Project
ID 1069, was submitted to CDM for claiming carbon credits for a fixed crediting period 
(01 Nov 03 and 31 Oct 13) but it was later withdrawn before registration.
_____________________
Hence, the project is not registered on any other GHG abatement mechanism and would not claim
credits under any such mechanisms except UCR.
_________________
Therefore, project will not cause double accounting of carbon credits (i.e. COUs).
